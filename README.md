UPDATE: I changed the count function it kind of sucked before, this means some of my instructions in the video are innnaccurate. Now you do not have to change anything to the count function when you add new result variables, but the name of each result variable has to be exactly the same as the name called in each count function. e.g. to add 1 point to a result called "meanPoints" you would call count('meanPoints').
